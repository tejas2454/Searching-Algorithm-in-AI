# Searching-Algorithm-in-AI
Search strategy followed:
For scheduling  the  presentations  in different sessions  we have used the hill climbing search strategy.
In this algorithm:
State : the next  presentation to be chosen 
Heuristic : Goodness   factor  of state-i  .
It gives the value of   Goodness   factor   if the next state to be chosen is “i”
So, the “s” number of  states  which gives  maximum  heuristic  is chosen  as presentations in the next session where, “s” is number of presentations in a session
